                    <p class="main__section1-text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                        JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of
                        your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <div class="main__section1-hr"></div>
                    <h2 class="main__section1-title">react fundamentals</h2>
                    <p class="main__section1-text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                        understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text"> <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
                        React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to
                        work in.</p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text"><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
                        lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                        "Text."Hello, I am your cat!"/Text".</p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text">The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
                        learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                        declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside "Text"</p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text"><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text"><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments
                        you use to configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage.
                        State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                        State gives your components memory!</p>

                    <h2 class="main__section1-title">handling text input</h2>
                    <p class="main__section1-text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
                        has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
                        and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p class="main__section1-text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
                        their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the
                        same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
